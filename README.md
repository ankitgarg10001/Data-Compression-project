Algorithms Project:
Data Compression and Decompression
In Data Compression or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by identifying marginally important information and removing it.
The Compression and Decompression involves many Algorithms. Some of them are:
  •	Lempel-Ziv-Storer-Szymanski(LZSS)   
  •	Run Length Algorithm
  •	Burrows Wheeler Transform(BWT)
  •	Move To Front
  •	Huffman Algorithm
